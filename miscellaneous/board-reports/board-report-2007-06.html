      <h1>Board Report (2007-06)</h1>
      <p><strong>[SUBMITTED]()</strong></p>
<p>Community
<em> Feathercast Felix podcast released.
</em> Presentations at OSGi Community Event on June 26/27.
<em> Added Clement Escoffier as a new committer.
</em> Added Niclas Hedhman as a new committer/PMC member.
<em> Continued work on web pages (e.g., new tutorials).
</em> Proposed slightly revised community roles/process document that takes into account our TLP move and explicitly resolves an issue that came up on the private mailing list regarding the nomination process for committers/PMC members.</p>
<p>Migration to TLP
<em> Verified committer access to new web site.
</em> Deleted incubator web site content.
<em> Removed incubator disclaimers from SVN and updated SVN artifacts to no longer mention the incubator or the old incubator web site or mailing lists; the only remaining incubator references are in our version numbers, which will be removed when we make our first non-incubator release.
</em> Still some minor incubator status page clean up remaining.</p>
<p>Software
<em> Some good commits in the area of specification compliance (one in the area of require-bundle functionality and another fix for a long standing issue for dynamic package imports) and in the area of performance (by adding package indexing to the framework resolver).
</em> Added experimental features to Felix to flesh out some potential ideas for next OSGi specification; these features are trying to deal with scenarios such as byte code injection in modules.
* Other various smallish improvement and minor bug fix commits.</p>
<p>Licensing and other issues
* None.</p>
