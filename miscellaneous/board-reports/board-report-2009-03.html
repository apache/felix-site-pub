<em> Niclas Hedhman stepped down from the Felix PMC.

* Marcel did a 15 minute lightning talk about Dynamic Deployment with Apache Felix at FOSDEM '09 in Brussels.</p>
<p>Software
<em> Attempt to integrate PAX Logging into Felix has apparently been abandoned due to lack of time by those involved.
</em> Preparing to release version 1.6.0 of Felix.
<em> Released version 1.4.1 of Felix (includes Framework 1.4.1 and Main 1.4.1); there were several small fixes and improvements in this release, but the main focus was to release patches needed by the CXF community to support distributed services.
</em> Released various other subprojects (e.g., iPOJO 1.2.0, Web Console 1.2.2, Remote Shell 1.0.4, Config Admin 1.0.10, Maven Bundle Plugin 2.0.0).
<em> Checked in a testing harness for both bundles and the framework itself based on bnd (from Peter Kriens).
</em> Added ConfigAdmin support and support for NIO for HTTPS to the HTTP Service implementation.
* Committed Device Access specification implementation, which was contributed by Dennis Geurts.</p>
<p>Licensing and other issues
* None.</p>
