      <p><strong>[SUBMITTED]()</strong></p>
<p>Community
<em> Presented Felix at ApacheCon US.
</em> Contributions from the CXF community for patches to Felix to support distributed OSGi features from the next OSGi specification release.
* Sun released GlassFish v3 Prelude, which includes Felix.</p>
<p>Software
<em> Still working on incorporating the new Log Service contribution from PAX; largely delayed due to a naming issue and lack of time.
</em> Released version 1.2.1 of Felix (includes Framework 1.2.1, Main 1.2.1) to address a performance regression.
<em> Released version 1.2.2 of Felix (includes Framework 1.2.2, Main 1.2.2) to address a security bug.
</em> Released version 1.4.0 of Felix (includes Framework 1.4.0, Main 1.4.0, Bundle Repository 1.2.1); this was a fairly major release including support for features from the coming OSGi R4.2 specification and many more resolved compliance issues and small bugs.
<em> Released various other subprojects (e.g., iPOJO 1.0.0, Web Console 1.2.0, Remote Shell 1.0.2, SCR 1.0.6, Maven SCR Plugin 1.0.8, Maven Bundle Plugin 1.4.3).
</em> Released subproject bundles are now available via an OBR repository for easy deployment into Felix (and other OSGi frameworks).
* Various fixes and enhancements to HTTP Service subproject, including improved alias resolution, better cache support with inclusion of Last Modified timestamps, and publishing actual ports used as service properties.</p>
<p>Licensing and other issues
* Need to investigate licensing issue for a JMX admin console contribution.</p>
