<span class="x">      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>
<span class="x">      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>

<span class="x">      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</span>
<span class="x">      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</span>
<span class="x">      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
<span class="x">      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
<span class="x">      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
<span class="x">      as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

<span class="x">   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>
<span class="x">      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</span>
<span class="x">      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</span>
<span class="x">      meet the following conditions:</span>

<span class="x">      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span>
<span class="x">          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

<span class="x">      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
<span class="x">          stating that You changed the files; and</span>

<span class="x">      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>
<span class="x">          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</span>
<span class="x">          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</span>
<span class="x">          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
<span class="x">          the Derivative Works; and</span>

<span class="x">      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
<span class="x">          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
<span class="x">          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
<span class="x">          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
<span class="x">          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
<span class="x">          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
<span class="x">          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
<span class="x">          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
<span class="x">          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
<span class="x">          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
<span class="x">          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
<span class="x">          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
<span class="x">          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
<span class="x">          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
<span class="x">          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
<span class="x">          as modifying the License.</span>

<span class="x">      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
<span class="x">      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
<span class="x">      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
<span class="x">      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
<span class="x">      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
<span class="x">      the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="x">   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
<span class="x">      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
<span class="x">      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
<span class="x">      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
<span class="x">      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
<span class="x">      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
<span class="x">      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="x">   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
<span class="x">      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
<span class="x">      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
<span class="x">      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="x">   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
<span class="x">      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
<span class="x">      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
<span class="x">      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
<span class="x">      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
<span class="x">      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
<span class="x">      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
<span class="x">      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
<span class="x">      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="x">   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
<span class="x">      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
<span class="x">      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
<span class="x">      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
<span class="x">      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
<span class="x">      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
<span class="x">      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
<span class="x">      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
<span class="x">      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
<span class="x">      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
<span class="x">      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="x">   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
<span class="x">      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
<span class="x">      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
<span class="x">      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
<span class="x">      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
<span class="x">      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
<span class="x">      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
<span class="x">      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
<span class="x">      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
<span class="x">      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

<span class="x">   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>
